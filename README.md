# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently doing some project for learning specification of some language. :smile:
And increase my capacity on computer science! :mortar_board:
So don't hesitate to say me tips! :four_leaf_clover:

If you want explication about one of my project or coding explication, I will be happy to answer this! :wink:
