# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is my Github profile, you can find here a part of my personnal projects and a list of my workshop for Epitech Toulouse! :wink:

I am in love with Artificial Intelligence for more than 8 years now! During those years, I done a lot of projects, some of my projects are on Github, but not all of them. :sweat_smile: But I listed the most interestings ones here! :smile:

> If you want more information you can find my portfolio [here](https://nathan-hoche.github.io/)

# My Project List

You can find here a list of my projects, with a description, a link to the repository, the status of the project, the language used and the technology used. :wink:

But, in order to underlight some of my projects, I will create a list of my favorite projects! :smile:
